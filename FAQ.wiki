== Why did you pull this functionality out of BatteryBot Pro? ==

The functionality never belonged in a battery app to begin with.  I
originally added it because I wanted to automatically have my lock
screen disabled while my device was plugged in and on my desk.  I
figured, "Hey my battery app already knows when the device is plugged
in or out, and it already has a background Service running at all
times; why don't I just add it to that?"  (Note: A Lock Block only
runs a background Service when actively blocking the lock screen.)

I regretted it many times over the years, since it doesn't fit in as
part of a battery app.  And I often wanted to improve the
lock-blocking functionality in ways that would be very difficult as
part of BatteryBot Pro.  But what finally pushed me over the edge was
wanting to use the space taken by the "Disable Lockscreen" button in
BatteryBot Pro for other, actually battery-related things.  I
conducted a poll on the BatteryBot Google Plus community, and the vast
majority of users either never used the lock-blocking functionality or
didn't mind it being pulled out into another app.

== Why is the app open source?  It's weird to have a paid app be open source. ==

For the same reason BatteryBot and Noteworthy Tuner are: I think open
source is great for the world and should be the default decision:
software should be open source unless there is a compelling reason to
keep the source closed.  All of my existing apps are open source, but
I do have one forthcoming that will remain closed.

I'm certain that I lose sales over this decision, but I hope that this
is at least partially offset by additional sales by people who
appreciate the decision to share my code.  I strongly believe in
giving back to the community, and I'm confident that I offer my
customers greater value with most of my apps being open source.
